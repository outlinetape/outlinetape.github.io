        <p class="intoduction"><a href="https://wiltedwoman.bandcamp.com" class="text-links">Wilted Woman</a> is an electronic musician living and working in Berlin, Germany. She makes electronic dance music, sort of, with elements reaching from noise and industrial to acid house and musique concrète. Wilted Woman has performed at venues across North America and Europe including Fylkingen (Stockholm), Les Brasseurs (Liège), C. Rockefeller Center for the Arts (Dresden) and Le Laboratoire (Boston).</p>
        <p class="questions">How did you start making music?</p>
        <p class="answers">I grew up studying classical violin and became interested in recording sounds and using electronics as instruments as a teenager.</p>
        <p class="questions">What was your first encounter with tapes?</p>
        <p class="answers">My early encounters with tapes are probably pretty normal– they were just what we listened to music on at home.</p>
        <p class="questions">Which hardware is your best friend? What are you using most nowadays?</p>
        <p class="answers">Hmm, not sure! I’ve been using basically the same rig for performance and recording for about two years now, so they are all pretty friendly to me.</p>
        <p class="questions">How are your covers (and titles) created?</p>
        <p class="answers">I’m really terrible at naming things and would prefer to have all my songs stay as ‘untitled 1’ ‘untitled 2’ et cetera.. unfortunately people aren’t so into this so I try and just think of short words or phrases for titles. For most of the releases I’ve done through other people’s labels, they came up with the artwork themselves.</p>
        <p class="questions">Who’s your favourite woman producer/DJ?</p>
        <p class="answers">I have a lot of favorites! Next month I am releasing an LP by Unicorn Hard-On so I definitely have to give her a shoutout :) Within the community I’m a part of, I feel surrounded by so many talented female/femme musicians. It feels silly to try and name them all but off the top of my head, besides Val (Unicorn Hard-On), I’m a big fan of Bridget Feral, Pamela_and_her_sons, RRLEW, Housefire, Chicklette, Iruu, Via App, James K…</p>
        <p class="questions">What is the record that means the most to you at the moment?</p>
        <p class="answers">This changes pretty often so it’s hard to say... I have a little label called untergang-institut and we are releasing the last Unicorn Hard-On record as she is starting a new project under her own name, Valerie Martino. <a href="https://untergang-institut.org/Unicorn-Hard-On-Dream-Machine" class="text-links">More info about the record here.</a></p>
